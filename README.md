## Personal Portfolio
Personal Portfolio Site to showcase my personal projects.

## Description
Personal Portfolio site made with React to showcase personal projects and to give some info about who I am. The site is intended to give an idea of who I am as a developer. It includes a bio section, project section, and contact info.

## Why?
The goal of this project was to make a portfolio site to showcase my personal projects. The portfolio itself is a personal project in and of itself, so if you are reading this then I hope you take a look through it or check out some of my other projects on [github](https://github.com/ryan-connor).
